Publisher for MkDocs is a set of plugins for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) that was created originally as "yet another blogging plugin for MkDocs". During a process of development, I realized that it can become something more that will help not only me with blog creation, but also as a part of a wider publishing tool, that can be used with cooperation with an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) that is a tool for creating a second brain and also an excellent Markdown files editor.

All plugins are part of this package and cannot be installed separately, but not all of them have to be enabled (more about this you can find in the [Setup section](/setup/))
