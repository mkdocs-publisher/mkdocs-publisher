So far, this whole documentation was created inside the Obsidian but since all the files are just a flat text file written using Markdown syntax, you were unable to see it. The reason for that was simple: integration with Obsidian was not \"mature\" enough to be presented. You can ask: \"Why? Obsidian just uses the same Markdown syntax as MkDocs uses.\". The answer to that is not so obvious. The simple answer is just \"yes\", but the real answer is \"not always\". Obsidian introduces some additional syntax options like callouts (equivalent to Markdown admonitions) and WikiLinks for creating internal links. If you use them \"as is\" in MkDocs, you will see a pure (not parsed) text, not the intended one since MkDocs does not understand this syntax. To make it \"understandable\" for MkDocs, it has to be \"translated\" into regular Markdown syntax.

The answer to that is not so obvious. The simple answer is just \"yes\", but the real answer is \"not always\". Obsidian introduces some additional syntax options like callouts (equivalent to Markdown admonitions) and WikiLinks for creating internal links. If you use them \"as is\" in MkDocs, you will see a pure (not parsed) text, not the intended one since MkDocs does not understand this syntax. To make it \"understandable\" for MkDocs, it has to be \"translated\" into regular Markdown syntax. For that reason, a new plugin was created, that supports not only the mentioned Obsidian elements, but also some additional ones like:</p> <ul> <li>backlinks,</li> <li>charts (using Vega visualization plugin for Obsidian),</li> <li>mind maps (using Mindmap NextGen plugin for Obsidian).</li> </ul> <p>If you need support for additional plugins, please make an issue with a future description.</p> <p>For more details about this release, read more below or jump directly to pub-obsidian plugin documentation.</p>          Read more"}]}
