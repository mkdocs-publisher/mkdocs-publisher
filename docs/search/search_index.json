During a process of development, I realized that it can become something more that will help not only me with blog creation, but also as a part of a wider publishing tool. Documents creation can be used with cooperation with an Obsidian.md that is a tool for creating a second brain and also an excellent Markdown files editor.</p> <p>Currently, this plugin is also written with strict cooperation with Material for MkDocs theme. It was not tested on any, and probably some functionalities may not work as intended (for example, formatting of blog posts). However, all the plugins that are included in this package should work separately and not all of them have to be enabled (for example, pub-minifier will work with any other set of plugins).</p>"},{"location":"#core-concepts","title":"Core concepts","text":"<p>Publisher for MkDocs is a set of plugins that was created with the below concepts:</p> <p>User-friendly</p> <p>The whole process of installation and configuration should be as simple as possible, so it's harder to get stuck just at the beginning of the way. Most of the settings are predefined the way, that the author of the documentation doesn't have to spend much time on configuration, etc. I know that some elements are still overly complicated, but the development process is not finished, so there is always a room for improvements. On the other hand, this tool will always be limited by the design of the tools that it's relay on. Usually, whenever possible, this tool should simplify the whole process of documentation publication.</p> <p>Optimized for SEO</p> <p>All the documents, if created with World Wide Web publication in mind, should be SEO optimized, so they are easier to find by any search engines. SEO it's not only about information that documents contain, but also with some more technical aspects like file size, interlinking, page load time, etc. All those aspects are quite technical one and not always taken into consideration when an author writes any piece of written text. For that reason, this tool is written the way, that the author doesn't have to think about some of those aspects. Some of the aspects are also described in this documentation as part of the documentation process creation.</p> <p>Obsidian.md as first party editor</p> <p>Obsidian.md is becoming the tool for creating Personal Knowledge Management (or just PKM). If you don't know this tool, but you are using any note-taking app like Notion, Evernote, etc. You should definitely try Obsidian. Why? It's because it allows you to achieve much more than any of the above tools and your notes are stored in Markdown files, so it's a great fit for MkDocs since both tools use this format. What's more interesting, Obsidian has lots of community plugins that allow you to achieve more, and some of them are also a great fit for documentation creation and allow you to speed up the process of writing it. This entire documentation was written using Obsidian with all Publisher for MkDocs plugins enabled. You are not forced to use Obsidian for editing, but its worth trying/</p>"},{"location":"#included-features","title":"Included features","text":"<p>The list of most important features built into MkDocs Publisher:</p> <ul> <li>creating a blog posts with automatic build of archive, categories, tags, and index pages (pub-blog plugin),</li> <li>social cards metadata creation based on document metadata (pub-social plugin -  v0.5.0),</li> <li>file size optimizations, that is beneficial for site download speed and SEO (pub-minifier plugin -  v0.4.0),</li> <li>automatic documents navigation creation (pub-meta plugin -  v0.6.0),</li> <li>documents publication status with additional meta-data like URL names, etc. beneficial for SEO (pub-meta plugin -  v0.6.0),</li> <li>integration with Obsidian.md as documentation editor with support for some Markdown syntax specific to it and some plugins (pub-obsidian plugin  v0.6.0):<ul> <li>backlinks,</li> <li>callouts ,</li> <li>wikilinks</li> <li>vega charts (using Vega Visualization Plugin for Obsidian) - advanced solution for creating charts.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"setup/installation/","title":"Installation","text":"<p>All plugins are part of this package and cannot be installed separately, but not all of them have to be enabled.</p> <p>Publisher for MkDocs is a Python package that can be installed using <code>pip</code> (ideally inside a virtual environment) or any other package manager like <code>poetry</code> that handles virtual management out of the box.</p> pippoetry <pre><code>pip install mkdocs-publisher\n</code></pre> <pre><code>poetry add mkdocs-publisher\n</code></pre> <p>This package depends on some other Python packages and MkDocs plugins, so during installation they will also be installed.

The main reason for that is how MkDocs internals work. For example, when navigation is built and when final HTML files are generated. Other example could be a document status implementation that influences navigation building, file list creation and <code>sitemap.xml</code> creation. This process should be considered as one functionality and splitting it over 2 separate plugins is possible, but it will not only increase code complexity, but also will increase significantly complexity of configuration since many settings used for automatic navigation building are the same for defining file meta-data. So, if we split functionality into 2 separate plugins, the final user (You) will have to maintain consistency in <code>mkdocs.yml</code> file.

So far, this whole documentation was created inside the Obsidian but since all the files are just a flat text file written using Markdown syntax, you were unable to see it. The reason for that was simple: integration with Obsidian was not \"mature\" enough to be presented. You can ask: \"Why? Obsidian just uses the same Markdown syntax as MkDocs uses\". The answer to that is not so obvious. The simple answer is just \"yes\", but the real answer is \"not always\". Obsidian introduces some additional syntax options like callouts (equivalent to Markdown admonitions) and WikiLinks for creating internal links. If you use them \"as is\" in MkDocs, you will see a pure (not parsed) text, not the intended one since MkDocs does not understand this syntax. To make it \"understandable\" for MkDocs, it has to be \"translated\" into regular Markdown syntax. For that reason, a new plugin was created, that supports not only the mentioned Obsidian elements, but also some additional ones like:</p> <ul> <li>backlinks,</li> <li>callouts ,</li> <li>wikilinks</li> <li>vega charts (using Vega Visualization Plugin for Obsidian) - advanced solution for creating charts,</li> <li>mind maps (using Mindmap NextGen plugin for Obsidian).</li> </ul> <p>If you need support for additional plugins, please make an issue with a future description.</p> <p>For more details about this release, read more below or jump directly to pub-obsidian plugin documentation.</p> <p>PS. I need to start to implement unit tests because this project becomes too big to test it manually and deliver production grade quality. Probably after introducing unit tests, I will end the beta period of this project and consider it as a production ready.
