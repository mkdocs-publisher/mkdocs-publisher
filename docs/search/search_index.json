During a process of development, I realized that it can become something more that will help not only me with blog creation, but also as a part of a wider publishing tool. Documents creation can be used with cooperation with an Obsidian.md that is a tool for creating a second brain and also an excellent Markdown files editor.</p> <p>Currently, this plugin is also written with strict cooperation with Material for MkDocs theme. It was not tested on any, and probably some functionalities may not work as intended (for example, formatting of blog posts). However, all the plugins that are included in this package should work separately and not all of them have to be enabled (for example, pub-minifier will work with any other set of plugins).</p>"},{"location":"#core-concepts","title":"Core concepts","text":"<p>Publisher for MkDocs is a set of plugins that was created with the below concepts:</p> <p>User-friendly</p> <p>The whole process of installation and configuration should be as simple as possible, so it's harder to get stuck just at the beginning of the way. Most of the settings are predefined the way, that the author of the documentation doesn't have to spend much time on configuration, etc. I know that some elements are still overly complicated, but the development process is not finished, so there is always a room for improvements. On the other hand, this tool will always be limited by the design of the tools that it's relay on. Usually, whenever possible, this tool should simplify the whole process of documentation publication.</p> <p>Optimized for SEO</p> <p>All the documents, if created with World Wide Web publication in mind, should be SEO optimized, so they are easier to find by any search engines. SEO it's not only about information that documents contain, but also with some more technical aspects like file size, interlinking, page load time, etc. All those aspects are quite technical one and not always taken into consideration when an author writes any piece of written text. For that reason, this tool is written the way, that the author doesn't have to think about some of those aspects. Some of the aspects are also described in this documentation as part of the documentation process creation.</p> <p>Obsidian.md as first party editor</p> <p>Obsidian.md is becoming the tool for creating Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) or a Second Brain. If you don't know this tool, but you are using any note-taking app like Notion, Evernote, etc. You should definitely try Obsidian. Why? It's because it allows you to achieve much more than any of the above tools and your notes are stored in Markdown files, so it's a great fit for MkDocs since both tools use this format. What's more interesting, Obsidian has lots of community plugins that allow you to achieve more, and some of them are also a great fit for documentation creation and allow you to speed up the process of writing it. This entire documentation was written using Obsidian with all Publisher for MkDocs plugins enabled.

So, why it's so essential?</p> <p>There are a few reasons:</p> <ol> <li>Automatic navigation building based on file and directory names. This simplifies a process of a document navigation creation in <code>mkdocs.yml</code> file, described in official documentation.</li> <li>Based on file meta-data, you can set document:<ul> <li>URL,</li> <li>creation/update date,</li> <li>document publication state,</li> <li>and some other less important.

The main reason for that is how MkDocs internals work. For example, when navigation is built and when final HTML files are generated. Other example could be a document status implementation that influences navigation building, file list creation and <code>sitemap.xml</code> creation. This process should be considered as one functionality and splitting it over 2 separate plugins is possible, but it will not only increase code complexity, but also will increase significantly complexity of configuration since many settings used for automatic navigation building are the same for defining file meta-data. So, if we split functionality into 2 separate plugins, the final user (You) will have to maintain consistency in <code>mkdocs.yml</code> file. With a single plugin approach, we can reduce this problem to just maintaining a single point of configuration and settings validation.</p> <p>Important</p> <p>However, this plugin is not needed for other plugins to work correctly, it's highly recommended to use it.</p>"},{"location":"02_setup/general/pub-meta/#meta-data","title":"Meta-data","text":"<p>Markdown documents can contain additional metadata that is not rendered by MkDocs.

Currently, this is the only way to provide functionality like single document or directories status.</p> <p>In short, navigation automatic generation works based on alphabetical order of files and directories. If you are using any IDE (like PyCharm, VsCode or Obsidian) for documents creation and editing, the way of file order you see by default in the project or file browser of the tool, is the order of the files in navigation. Probably the easiest way of file ordering is to provide some prefix with the digits (take a look at this documentation repository for better understanding). The main problem with this approach would be strange names in file URLs and documentation titles on the web page. To solve that problems, the meta plugin uses two meta-data values that are common for document files and directories:</p> <code>title</code><code>slug</code> <p><code>title</code> is responsible for document name that is visible in the generated web page.</p> <pre><code>---\ntitle: Document title\n---\n</code></pre> <p><code>slug</code> is responsible for document URL.</p> <pre><code>---\nslug: document-slug\n---\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"02_setup/general/pub-meta/#document-publication-status","title":"Document publication status","text":"<p>One of the functions provided by the meta plugin is a possibility to set document status.

I have promised to make smaller releases, but my brain is refusing me to work on a small scale. It's really hard to achieve that, especially when I started to have some feedback from you, users of this tool. Because of that feedback and some problems you encountered, I decided to focus in this release on 2 main topics: some bug fixing and introducing a new plugin called pub-debugger. This plugin allows for an insight into all messages produced by plugins while building (or serving) a web page. Also, it's able to produce a ZIP file, with some basic information that could help me, whenever you will need to report an issue.</p><p>-  logger names unification - it's related to pub-debugger plugin</p></p> Changelog <p><p>-  logger names unification - it's related to pub-debugger plugin</p></p>"},{"location":"how-to-publish/first-steps/","title":"First steps","text":"<p>This section is in backlog.</p> <p>Currently, please take a look at installation and each plugin configuration section of this documentation.</p>"},{"location":"blog/v010/","title":"v0.1.0 - Initial release","text":"<p>Another blogging plugin for MkDocs?

So far, this whole documentation was created inside the Obsidian but since all the files are just a flat text file written using Markdown syntax, you were unable to see it. The reason for that was simple: integration with Obsidian was not \"mature\" enough to be presented. You can ask: \"Why? Obsidian just uses the same Markdown syntax as MkDocs uses\". The answer to that is not so obvious. The simple answer is just \"yes\", but the real answer is \"not always\". Obsidian introduces some additional syntax options like callouts (equivalent to Markdown admonitions) and WikiLinks for creating internal links. If you use them \"as is\" in MkDocs, you will see a pure (not parsed) text, not the intended one since MkDocs does not understand this syntax. To make it \"understandable\" for MkDocs, it has to be \"translated\" into regular Markdown syntax.</p> <p>Translation is non-destructive</p> <p>All markdown translations (or rather I should say conversions) are non-destructive to your Obsidian vault and occurs \"on the fly\" while static files are produced. It means that you can use this plugin side-by-side with Obsidian and use, for example, git repository as your vault backup. You don't have to copy or specially prepare your files before using this tool.</p> <p>For that reason, a new plugin was created, that supports not only the mentioned Obsidian elements, but also some additional ones like:</p> <ul> <li>backlinks,</li> <li>callouts,</li> <li>wikilinks,</li> <li>vega charts (using Vega Visualization Plugin for Obsidian) - advanced solution for creating charts.</li> </ul> <p>If you need support for additional plugins, please make an issue with a future description.</p> <p>For more details about this release, read more below or jump directly to pub-obsidian plugin documentation.</p> <p>I need to start to implement unit tests because this project becomes too big to test it manually and deliver production grade quality.

When I shared information about Publisher for MkDocs over an official Obsidian.md community forum the developer of an Obsidian GitHub Publisher plugin provided me information that we have some conflict related to our plugins name. We were also spoken privately over Discord and came to some agreement related to our work. More information can be found in this thread, but in short:</p> <ul> <li>My set of MkDocs plugins will be called Publisher for MkDocs since my work is related to MkDocs with additional support for Obsidian as an IDE/text editor,</li> <li>Mara-Li Obsidian plugin will be called GitHub Publisher since her work is related to Obsidian with the possibility to use MkDocs as a beck-end for publication.</li> </ul> <p>In the feature, some elements of this project could be part of Mara-Li work, but it's her decision. I will continue working on this project and help her with some potential issues solving.</p> <p>I have also spent some time on unification of look the setup documentation. Previously, documentation was created a similar way as Material for MkDocs is doing it, but I decided to drop this approach and simplify it a little bit. Most of the work was around configuration options, that was too verbose. Currently, all configuration options related to given functionality are gathered in a single code block with their default values, so it's easier to copy it to yours <code>mkdocs.yaml</code> file. As a result, all descriptions related to those options are placed below this code block, so it's easy to find the information about it. I hope it's now easier to navigate and understand all the configuration options.</p> <p>A lot of you have been asking me about comparison to other tools and I have answered to them in this Reddit thread.

I'm aware that this is the biggest lacking right now of this project that is supposed to be related to publishing, and I will definitely solve this soon.
