In this release, many things have happened, but the most important one is a project rename.

During a development, many ideas about further development came to my mind. I have created a [backlog](https://mkusz.github.io/mkdocs-publisher/dev/backlog/).

## Features implemented

### General

- :material-sync-circle: project name
- :material-plus-circle: cross configuration of blog and auto-nav plugins:
	  - blog does not add auto-nav meta files
	  - auto-nav automatically adds blog directory to skipped directories since it will be built by blog
	  - if one of the plugins is not enabled, other is not using its values
- :material-plus-circle: documentation

### Blog

- :material-plus-circle: possibility to choose a blog as a starting page with option to define manually blog in nav configuration
- :material-plus-circle: `slug` config option for setting an entire blog's main directory URL
- :material-sync-circle: internal file structure refactor with new global plugin config (`BlogConfig` class) that will help with further development with small fixes and improvements
- :material-sync-circle: blog subdirectory navigation creation (entry path needs to be equal to subdirectory name)
- :material-check-circle: live reload infinite loop during `serve` caused by temporary files created and removed in blog directory
- :material-check-circle: navigation is no longer overridden by a blog (if there is no other nav, blog will create on with recent posts as a main page)

### Minifier (new plugin)

- :material-plus-circle: PNG image minifier (using: pngquant and oxipng)
