In this release, many things have happened, but the most important one is a project rename.

During a development, a lot of ideas about further development came to my mind. I have created a [backlog](/mkdocs-publisher/dev/backlog).

## Features implemented

### General:

- changed: project rename
- added: cross configuration of blog and auto-nav plugins:
  - blog does not add auto-nav meta files
  - auto-nav automatically adds blog directory to skipped directories since it will be built by blog
  - if one of the plugins is not enabled, other is not using its values
- add: documentation

### Blog:

- added: possibility to choose a blog as a starting page with option to define manually blog in nav configuration
- added: `slug` config option for setting an entire blog's main directory URL
- changed: internal file structure refactor with new global plugin config (BlogConfig class) that will help with further development with small fixes and improvements
- changed: blog subdirectory navigation creation (entry path needs to be equal to subdirectory name)
- fixed: live reload infinite loop during `serve` caused by temporary files created and removed in blog directory
- fixed: navigation is no longer overridden by a blog (if there is no other nav, blog will create on with recent posts as a main page)

### Minifier (new plugin):

- added: PNG image minifier (using: pngquant and oxipng)
- added: JPG image minifier (using: mozjpeg)
- added: SVG image minifier (using: svgo)
- added: HTML file minifier (using: html-minifier)
- added: CSS file minifier (using: postcss with plugins: cssnano, svgo)
- added: JS file minifier (using: uglifyjs)

### Auto-nav (new plugin):

- added: build navigation based on file names
- added: directory metadata and additional settings can be set in a frontmatter of `*.md` file (default to `README.md`)
