# mkdocs-publisher

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/mkdocs-blog-in.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/mkdocs-blog-in)
[![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/mkusz/mkdocs-blog-in/total.svg)]()

Publishing platform plugins for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) that includes:

- blog - adds blogging capability,
- minifier - file size optimization

## Another blogging plugin for MkDocs? But why?

The simplest answer is: because I couldn't find one good enough (and free).

The flip side of the same coin was that I wanted to migrate my personal blog related to [testing](https://testerembyc.pl) (sorry only in Polish, but you can try to use google translator) from [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/) that works quite well, but sometimes is overlly complicated, has almost none search functionality and markdown files are not the default one (but it's possible to use them). Why markdown format is so important? Becasue I love [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as a tool for gathering knowledge and this format is a crucial part of that tool.

At the time when this plugin was created, there was no free and qood alternatives. The only one that could be good enought was hidden behind a paid wall and was a part of a theme [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/blog/). Some of the ideas for this plugin and functionalities came from documentation of the Material for MkDocs theme, Nikola and other plugins.

Existing alternatives (with my comment):

- [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/blog/) - complex solution but paid,
- [mkdocs-blogging-plugin](https://github.com/liang2kl/mkdocs-blogging-plugin) - works, but very simple solution for very simple blog (limited tags usage, thame files modification neede, limited use of frontmatter, limited number of features),
- [mkdocs-blog-plugin](https://github.com/fmaida/mkdocs-blog-plugin) - no longer maintained and very simple,
- [python-mkblog](https://github.com/derJD/python-mkblog) - no longer maintained and very simple,
- [mkdocs-blog](https://github.com/andyoakley/mkdocs-blog) - no longer maintained and very simple,
- [material theme modification](https://www.dirigible.io/blogs/2021/11/2/material-blogging-capabilities/) - it's not a plugin, but comples theme modification, it's hard to extend and configure.

As you can see, there are just 2 still maintained plugins for blogging in MkDocs:
1. Material for MkDocs - complex but paid,
2. mkdosc-blogging-plugin - much simpler than Material for MkDocs.

At this moment (v0.4.0) of this plugin, it's functionality is somewhere in between those 2 (but closer to more complex solution). Since this is plugin that I will be using for my blog, it will be maintainted at least as long as my blog will be alive. I know that there is still a huge list of improvemnts I want to add (especially a documentation) but it's just a matter of time.

If you have an idea for some new functionality (or found a bug), please report and issue with a proper label.

> **Note**
> As a base for any development, mkdocs-material theme was used.

> **Warning**
> Consider this plugin as a beta, so before any use make sure you have a backup of your data.

If you have found any issue, have an idea for a feature, please submit an issue.

## Image optimization

Image optimization is needed for optimal web speed loading that is needed for better scoring on search engines (part of propper SEO). The best image optimization that redeuce image file size but not image quality.

Since 2 most used image formats are PNG and JPEG, this plugin offers image optimization option. Tools used for image optimization were chosen to fulfill both main image optimization purposes: high quality with small file size.

### MacOS installation

- PNG

```commandline
brew install pngquant oxipng

- JPEG

- SVG

## HTML, JS, CSS optimization

```

## Plugin development

```commandline

poetry add --editable ../mkdocs-publisher/

List of included features (more documentation is needed):
