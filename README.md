## Image optimization

Image optimization is needed for optimal web speed loading that is needed for better scoring on search engines (part of propper SEO). The best image optimization that redeuce image file size but not image quality.

Since 2 most used image formats are PNG and JPEG, this plugin offers image optimization option. Tools used for image optimization were chosen to fulfill both main image optimization purposes: high quality with small file size.

### PNG

External tools:
- `pngquant` - image compression by color space manipulation
- `oxipng` - lossless compression optimizer

#### Why using both tools?

The reason is very simple. Both tools are operating in 2 different aspects of PNG image. `pngquant` reduce file size by reducing color palette to 8-bit with alpha channel and `oxipng` is optimizing image data compression algorithm without touching image data. Unfortunatelly ther is no single tool that allows to perform both optimization.

#### Installation

- MacOS:

```commandline
brew install pngquant oxipng
```

- Ubuntu:
