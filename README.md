## Planned features

A full list of planned developments can be found on [this documentation page](https://mkusz.github.io/mkdocs-publisher/development/other/backlog/). I'm planning to move it to the project [GitHub issues](https://github.com/mkusz/mkdocs-publisher/issues) with proper badges and longer descriptions, but it's time-consuming and at this stage I'd rather spend it to develop a project.

## Version history

The entire version history can be found in the project [version history](https://mkusz.github.io/mkdocs-publisher/development/changelog/) document and inside [releases](https://github.com/mkusz/mkdocs-publisher/releases).
