In this release, many things have happened, but the most important one is a project rename.

During a development, many ideas about further development came to my mind. I have created a [backlog](../05_dev/other/02_backlog.md).

## Changelog

### :material-list-box: General

- ♻️ project name
- ❎ cross configuration of blog and auto-nav plugins:
	  - blog does not add auto-nav meta files
	  - auto-nav automatically adds blog directory to skipped directories since it will be built by blog
	  - if one of the plugins is not enabled, other is not using its values
- ❎ documentation

### :material-newspaper-variant-multiple: Blog

- ❎ possibility to choose a blog as a starting page with option to define manually blog in nav configuration
- ❎ `slug` config option for setting an entire blog's main directory URL
- ♻️ internal file structure refactor with new global plugin config (`BlogConfig` class) that will help with further development with small fixes and improvements
- ♻️ blog subdirectory navigation creation (entry path needs to be equal to subdirectory name)
- ✅ live reload infinite loop during `serve` caused by temporary files created and removed in blog directory
- ✅ navigation is no longer overridden by a blog (if there is no other nav, blog will create on with recent posts as a main page)
