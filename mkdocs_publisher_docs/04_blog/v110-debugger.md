Here we are with a new version of Publisher for MkDocs plugins. I have promised to make smaller releases, but my brain is refusing me to work on a small scale. It's really hard to achieve that, especially when you're starting to have some feedback from you, users of this tool. Because of that feedback and some problems you encountered, I decided to focus in this release on 2 main topics: some bug fixing and introducing a new plugin called [pub-debugger](../02_setup/99_setting-up-debugger.md). This plugin allows for an insight into all messages produced by plugins while building (or serving) a web page. Also, it's able to produce a ZIP file, with some basic information that could help me, whenever you will need to report an [issue](https://github.com/mkusz/mkdocs-publisher/issues).

> [!INFO] Privacy disclaimer
> Those ZIP files are produced on your machine, and you should make a review of the files that are included, before you share them over the internet.

There is also one very crucial topic related to this project name. When I shared information about Publisher for MkDocs over an [official Obsidian.md community forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/top?period=daily)
