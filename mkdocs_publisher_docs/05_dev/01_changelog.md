	- possibility to define `hidden_dir`(this affects only the directory and all subdirectories where the file is located)

### :simple-obsidian: Obsidian (new plugin)

This plugin is a set of functionalities and should be split into various smaller plugins, but due to some cross functionalities, it has been integrated into the bigger one.
