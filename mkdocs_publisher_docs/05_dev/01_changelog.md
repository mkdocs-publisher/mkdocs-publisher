### Meta (new plugin)

This plugin is a Swiss army knife that helps a lot with various tasks related to publication, SEO, etc. Take a look at the below changelog to see what is offered by this plugin.

- :material-plus-circle: build navigation based on file names order
- :material-plus-circle: set multiple document parameters by using its metadata:
	- `title` - document title
	- `slug`- URL of the document
	- `status` - document publication status (published, hidden, draft)
	- `date` - document creation date
	- `update` - document last update date (used for sitemap and SEO optimizations)
- :material-plus-circle: directory metadata and additional settings can be set in a frontmatter of `*.md` file (default to `README.md`):
	 	- possibility to define `slug`(this affects only the directory where `README.md` is placed)
	- possibility to define `skip_dir`(this affects only the directory and all subdirectories where the file is located)
	- possibility to define `hidden_dir`(this affects only the directory and all subdirectories where the file is located)

### Obsidian (new plugin)

This plugin is a set of functionalities and should be split into various smaller plugins, but due to some cross functionalities, it has been integrated into the bigger one. Each sub plugin can be controlled separately, so if you don't need all the functionalities, you can just disable them or simply do not enable one that are disabled by default.

#### General

- :material-plus-circle: server watch can omit `.obsidian` directory that needs to be a part of the documentation directory that is automatically added into watch and causes server reload on (almost) any interaction with obsidian (changing settings etc.)

#### Links

- :material-plus-circle: support for wiki links format for images and internal links
- :material-plus-circle: configurable image lazy loading option (SEO optimization)
- :material-plus-circle: documents and images file path solver (it doesn't affect documentation, but it's required by MkDocs for proper links generation)

#### Callouts

- :material-plus-circle: mapping of all Obsidian callouts into Markdown admonitions

#### Backlinks

- :material-plus-circle: auto-generation of backlinks for all internal documents (visible as an custom admonition at the bottom of the page)
- :material-plus-circle: backlinks are not generated for blog temporary files like post indexes, archive, tags and categories
- :material-plus-circle: backlinks are grouped per page like in Obsidian (if more than one link is pointing from one page to another, all context links will be visible)

#### Charts

- :material-plus-circle: support for *vega* and *vega-lite* charts when added by [Vega Visualization Plugin for Obsidian](https://github.com/Some-Regular-Person/obsidian-vega)
