It's a quick release related to bug fixes I have found when trying to update one of my own pages with v1.3.0. There is no new functionality here, only fixes related mostly to rewritten functionality of [meta plugin](../03_setup/02_general/01_setting-up-meta.md). I definitely need to work on some additional E2E tests to cover some of the aspects because this functionality was fully covered with unit tests.
